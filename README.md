platypus.js
===========
My personal Javascript package that automatically inserts my favorite libraries with `script src` elements. Also has some simple functions. It's not much right now, but I hope to make it a useful package for web development in the future. Contact me on **Discord** if you have feedback or ideas for libraries and functions. My username is **patchthecat12**.
