platypus.js
===========
My personal Javascript package that automatically inserts my favorite libraries with `script src` elements. Also has some simple functions.

Libraries
---------
Here is a list of libraries that platypus.js includes:

* [jQuery v3.7.1, compressed](jquery.com)
* [Parsley v2.9.2](parsley.org)
* [include.js](morgan3d.github.io/include.js)

  _(also please tell me if the way I attributed them in the files does not comply with the licenses! I'm not sure the best way to do it (especially with the compressed version))_
